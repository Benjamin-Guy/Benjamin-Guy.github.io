# Creating a Neural Network Model for Classifying Ten Different Animals

Today I applied the knowledge and skills I learnt from the bird classification model and created a new multiclass classification model for ten different animals. This task was relatively straightforward as the foundational steps taken to scrape the images, train the model, and make predictions was very similar to the bird classification model task.
