# Bird Classification Example

Reading this has shown me that it is much more simpler to use deep learning to recognise a bird than I had originally thought. However, when trying to run the example code I ran into many issues. First was that I was unable to run the code in the kaggle environment. After, I then created a Jupyter Notebook using Anaconda and I was able to import and use libraries necessary. However I ran into another issue where I was unable to use duckduckgo_search. This was fixed after adjusting the code. Now that it is working I am much more confident in applying deep learning to recognise birds!
