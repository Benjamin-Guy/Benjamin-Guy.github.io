# Stable Diffusion

Whilst looking at the CIFAKE data and learning about what it was, I learnt that the fake images in the dataset were generated by Stable Diffusion. I previously used Stable Diffusion on my own computer and found this topic very interesting. One thing that I have noticed is that the images produced by Stable Diffusion have a lot of abnormalities and artefacts in the generated images. Things like extra limbs, disfigured faces, unnatural landscapes, no shadows, poor reflections were very common in the generated images of the base stable diffusion model. A lot of examples shown online of AI-generated images also tend to be of very simple objects or design. Things like 'pink elephant weaing a hat on the moon' show the imaginative performance of the model but don't show the actual capabilties of the model.
