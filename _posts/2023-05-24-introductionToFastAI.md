# What is Deep Learning
Today I learnt what deep learning is. It is a computer technique for extracting and transforming data using multiple layers in neural networks. These neural networks can learn to perform a specific task. They are used in computer vision, natural language processing, image generation, and robotics for example. I do have some prior experience working with and creating neural networks using TensorFlow for time-series forecasting, so it will be really interesting to get to learn how to use neural networks for computer vision problems. Personally, I am excited to learn about computer vision as it provides a direct way for computers to interact with the real-world using sensors such as cameras.
